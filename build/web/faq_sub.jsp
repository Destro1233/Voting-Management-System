  <div class="element" title="Q1.Why a voter must vote?" dojoType="dijit.layout.ContentPane">
   <p>A1.Voting is the essence of a democracy. Voting is our
										voice, and we should let our voices be heard by voting in all
										elections.Voting is our right .Voting systems are important
										as they determine who is elected, which voters are
										represented, and ultimately who runs our local, state, and
										federal legislatures. Who is elected directly affects what
										kinds of policies are passed and who benefits or suffers from
										those policies? Since it matters greatly who wins elections,
										voting systems matter as well, because different methods of
										voting can produce different winners. For example, in
										winner-take all voting systems, only the candidate supported
										by the majority or plurality of voters in the district wins
										office.</p>
                                        <p>Voting helps shape your community.
										it's important to vote because of the great amount of power
										politicians have - particularly the control they have over the
										institutions of everyday life: education, health, policing and
										social services. A general election is the public's big chance
										to change how those institutions are run.
										</p>

										<u>Benefits of voting</u>
										<p>You can choose your government
										this is one of the biggest benefits of voting. Never
										underestimate your vote. This could be the deciding vote, so
										be sure to vote your favorite candidates most deserving.
										Voting allows you to choose the people who want to represent
										government. The winning party will determine the company to be
										responsible for you. Imagine if we do manage events in the
										country, who see in him the responsibility? So the
										government?s choice in voting is essential to control the
										administrative chaos in society. Therefore, you must vote for
										the presidential election and local elections of the body.
										</p>
										<p>Initial investment for a better future The only purpose of
										government is the development and implementation of various
										policies for the benefit of all its inhabitants. Since the tax
										rate on the inflation rate, this is decided by politicians to
										vote and to help them win. They decide everything else about
										his career and life; why not vote for a better person because
										you can make intelligent decisions about your life. When you
										vote, you have the right to request clarifications and answers
										about broken promises. But when you do not vote, remember do
										not even have the right to complain or condemn, it is
										important to vote in a democracy.</p>
										<p>Democracy is a relatively new form of democracy. We
										have previously dominated by different types of governments,
										tyranny, dictatorship, autocrats, kings, and many foreign
										colonies where the common man has no freedom or right to
										choose their government. Neglected their needs and
										requirements to get a vote, how many people have worked
										tirelessly over many generations have shed their blood
										constantly. As they say, nothing is free, and remains true for
										the right to vote. In many countries women are not allowed to
										vote, have never been decisive decision-making process.
										Currently, there are many countries where voting for the
										common man is not allowed. You should see the struggles and
										problems faced by people in those countries, so that you
										understand the importance of voting.</p><br>
